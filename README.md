# Tutor AI – Personalised Progress Tracker for Tutors

A lightweight tool built for private tutors to track student progress in 7+ UK school-level Maths, identify topic strengths/weaknesses, and automatically generate personalised worksheets for upcoming sessions using AI.

---

## Project Purpose

Many tutors lack a structured system to:
- Track student performance over time
- Identify trends in topic mastery
- Know what to focus on in the next session

**Tutor AI** solves this by acting as a central, intelligent database that logs sessions, monitors topic performance, and uses AI to create tailored practice material.

---

## Project Outcome

- A simple UI where tutors can:
  - Log students and sessions
  - View topic-level trends per student
  - Instantly generate custom worksheets using GPT
- A local SQLite database to persist student data
- A scalable Python backend that could later be deployed or extended into a web app
